    "# Optimization of building energy efficiency interventions using BlocPower data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Building decarbonization is a critical component of the multiple transitions needed to combat climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides unprecedented incentives for households to install home improvements for electrification and energy efficiency, like installing heat pumps instead of fossil-fuel powered heaters and weatherization/insulation (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/tax-breaks-inflation-reduction-act.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "These efforts have been aided by technological advances in the form of fine-grained building-level data, recently available at nationwide scale. One such dataset - developed by BlocPower - uses data on building type and equipment (single -family/multi-family, heating and cooling systems) sourced from tax assessment records. It then uses them as inputs for energy modeling algorithms/software developed by the Department of Energy. Crucially, this allows estimation of counterfactuals, i.e. the reduction in energy usage that would result from targeted retrofits. BlocPower’s own core operation takes building data for a city, uses their proprietary algorithm to estimate the ideal intervention, potential cost of a retrofit, and projected reduction in energy use (it also provides financing options).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finance is the key variable in these ambitious transition plans. Many of the new policies provide incentives like tax credits and rebates, instead of direct transfers to finance retrofits. However, it is useful to get an estimate of the total cost required to achieve a specified reduction in energy use and emissions from buildings. (This is also useful where governments are spending money directly to decarbonize their own building portfolios). https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-first-ever-federal-building-performance-standard-catalyzes-american-innovation-to-lower-energy-costs-save-taxpayer-dollars-and-cut-emissions/\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of possible interventions for each building can consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weatherization\n",
    "Energy efficiency retrofits/electrification\n",
    "Rooftop solar\n",
    "Linear programming formulation\n",
    "Despite some differences in these particular interventions, the basic structure requires an upfront cost to be spent on a building, after which its energy usage will go down by some factor (i.e. there will be energy savings). For our current purpose, let weatherization be the only building intervention we consider. We abstract away the exact financing mechanisms included in the IRA and BIL (rebates and incentives), and assume that the local government has a fixed budget to allocate for weatherizing buildings. The objective is to maximize energy savings - or equivalently, reduce emissions - subject to the constraint that the total cost cannot be larger than the budget. For this, we need recommendations of which buildings to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear programming is a well-established mathematical tool used for policy purposes, starting from optimizing military logistics during WW2 to optimizing the energy source mixture (see appendix). This problem formulation fits well with a linear programming framework. Specifically, this is an example of a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem, as the solution must be an integer (we can't weatherize 3.6 buildings).\n",
